# Time-based-AC-Load-Controller
In this project , i tried to solve the problem of switch ON and switch OFF summer sewell water pump manually. This is mostly for those farmers who have their fields in forest or too far away from their homes. And this is not possible to go to field to switch on or switch off the water pump, for their irrigation, as in my case also. Using these project you just need to feed the time only and whenever light will come irrigation will start automatically and will run till fed time. If in case light went before completion of time and came back ,timer will resume from previous time only.
